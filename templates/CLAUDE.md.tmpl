# CLAUDE.md - Iter Default Process

This file was auto-generated by iter v{{.Version}}. You can customize it.

## CRITICAL: Index-First Code Discovery

Before using grep or file search, ALWAYS use the semantic index:

```bash
iter search "<query>"    # Semantic code search
iter deps "<symbol>"     # Show what symbol depends on
iter impact "<file>"     # Show what's affected by file changes
iter history            # Show commit lineage summaries
```

The semantic index understands code structure and relationships, providing more accurate results than grep.

## Default Process Phases

When running `iter "<task>"`, the following phases execute automatically:

### 1. WORKDIR
Artifacts are stored in `.iter/workdir/{timestamp}/`

### 2. WORKTREE
Git worktree isolation ensures changes don't affect your main branch until completion.

### 3. ARCHITECT
Plan before implementing:
- Analyze requirements
- Create step documents (step_N.md)
- Identify cleanup and technical debt

### 4. WORKERS
Implement one step at a time:
- Follow step document EXACTLY
- Verify build passes
- Document implementation

### 5. VALIDATION
Review with adversarial stance:
- **DEFAULT: REJECT**
- Verify all acceptance criteria
- Check for dead code and cleanup

### 6. DOCUMENTOR
On completion:
- Update relevant documentation
- Create summary of changes
- Merge worktree to main branch

## Session Management

```bash
iter status            # Show current session status
iter step [N]          # Show step instructions
iter pass              # Record validation pass
iter reject "reason"   # Record rejection with reason
iter next              # Move to next step
iter complete          # Finalize session (merges worktree)
iter reset             # Abort session
```
